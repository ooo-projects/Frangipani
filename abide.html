&emsp;I was glad that he had wanted to come up from the hold, even though I suspected his reasons, and none of them seemed, to me, to be particularly auspicious. The sea at that hour was like a giant, begrimed mirror, winking lewdly so far below us that we seemed rather to be coasting through black skies than to be cresting through dim oceans. Because it rained, you really couldn&#39;t see a thing. 
<br>
&emsp;Moreover, there was something the matter with Amiel&#39;s arm. I had noticed it. He crooked his elbow and held it out from his side. At alternate moments, subject to the dilation of my awareness, we either seemed to stand within a night that silence had stifled or in the roar of a horrid, deep clamor made up of the groaning whir of obscure engines, the murmuring rain, the sharp plashes of our demolition course through the breakers, and the jarring noise of human intercourse below.
<br>
&emsp;Each of the tiny raindrops felt as hot as a spark when it struck our exposed skin. And the rain was so liberal in its onslaught that standing up there was a little like being bathed in fire. I searched my heart fastidiously and found that there was nothing that I wanted to say to him. Not yet! However, I knew that, in thirteen days, however unreal that space of time must appear to me now, I was capable of saying much - yes, a great deal. Naturally not everything, but certainly all that needed to be said and even perhaps a little more, if I forgot to be judicious. As a matter of fact, that was largely why I was so glad to have come up out of the hold. 
<br>
&emsp;That is, the need for judiciousness. We couldn&#39;t see one another clearly, much less anything else; even the autumn moon declined to show her face - and that took off some of the pressure. What with the wildering mist of rain and the darkness, it was as though the Earth had suddenly decided, wantonly, to give up all her dimensions. We were enveloped in a cold, colorless fog, and it drew into me eerily. A cold fog was in fact just what I felt myself to be becoming... 
<br>
&emsp;But there was an idea on the loose sufficiently perplexing to halt the process of my sublimation. What puzzled me was the revelation of Amiel&#39;s new aura. Or perhaps - no - it was almost a nuisance. A source of irritation. Yes - for he had wilted a little. 
<br>
&emsp;In any event, a transformation had occurred that was, to my mind, on the order of a reduction - for, on the one hand, he had begun to seem more tranquil, and on the other he had acquired a new aspect of frailty.
<br>
&emsp;But they didn&#39;t appear to worry him in the least - these odd depletions. I examined his profile in the residual illumination from the window of the unspeakably hazardous double-acting door that led down to the hold, and I distinctly saw him smile. He was much thinner in the face - thin to gauntness. It was difficult to tell about the rest of him, due to the length of his gray coat. His eyes had deepish bags underneath them, which was however nothing new. It was the serenity of that smile, which I would have said verged on idiocy, that shocked me and cast the other changes in an unsavory light.  
<br>
&emsp;I looked on in something approaching horror until he noticed my staring and faced me, upon which all these notions vanished. Straight on, he was a great deal more like his old self - with an expression characteristically secretive, tender, and absent, and with the guileless absence that is typically in fact a sign of unusual capacity and great resources. It was not quite a smile, but it had indeed looked like one from the side. 
<br>
&emsp;I sighed - for I was relieved.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Would you prefer to go back down?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;&#34;No! I wouldn&#39;t.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;The vehemence of my denial had startled him - I could tell. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I like it out here. It&#39;s nice,&#34; I explained.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;But you&#39;re shivering!&#34;
<br>
&emsp;That was true, but this dance of solicitude was one of several charades that I had resolved firmly to forswear, on this occasion. I had imagined everything - nothing that can befall a person, in the period of our separation, had not crossed my mind as potentially befalling him in the very moment I thought of it. And, as a consequence, I was not prepared to allow him to coddle me in his usual manner. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;So? I like it.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Now, he really smiled, but it was not a smile of true pleasure. It was a smile of consternation. I imagined that he was asking himself why I had decided to be so perverse.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;We&#39;re alone here,&#34; I said, biting down on my shivers.
<br>
&emsp;The rain had found its way underneath my collar. It dampened my shirt. The dampness lay on my sternum, and, as a result, no other part of me felt warm. I may as well have been wearing snow. I was feeble with cold. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Yes. We&#39;re alone&#8230;&#34;
<br>
&emsp;It was good to hear him affirm it because our segregation, to me, was paramount. It made almost the only difference. The endeavor to match the outside to the inside in this regard had defined and structured our union - if a thing so perforated on the axes of time and space could rightly be called a union. 
<br>
&emsp;It had structured, in any case, our encounters, and I had grown used to it and fond of it. What I mean to say is that I had grown accustomed - because I alone on Earth knew his true identity - to the search for hideaways - for leas and burrows.
<br>
<br>
&emsp;We debarked amid a stream of relatively faceless passengers onto a moonlit harbor that was as appallingly silent as if the entire island had been visited by plague. I stood in wonder. The serenity of the nighttime quay was so impressively total that I felt myself, who had been raised on that shadowy clump of land, to be an interloper. 
<br>
&emsp;But it was home, and what must prove it, if nothing else, was the fact that I was now leading Amiel, who was a visitor there, through an alley between two bar-caf&eacute;s that were already closed for the season, into an extraordinarily tiny plaza - cobblestoned, of course - one of many such insignificant squares in our town - and further up one of the spidery, sloped avenues (in fact the steepest of them) that communicated with the residential portions of the island. 
<br>
&emsp;Which is not to say that I led him to the portion of the island where the locals lived. For, in spite of my condition - that of having nowhere that I could say that I was from, other than a little scrap of an islet four miles wide and six miles long on which others vacationed - I did not live near the locals, but in one of two or three little neighborhoods that was made up of exclusively of summer homes.
<br>
&emsp;And, to make matters worse, I hadn&#39;t been much among them - the locals - for I had schooled on the mainland throughout my career. First in a school that I commuted to by ferry and then bus, and, from the age of twelve, in a boarding school on the other side of the country. 
<br>
&emsp;And so therefore, in a manner of speaking, I was the thing that I had felt the shame of being when we debarked: a trespasser. Nor was the feeling actually new to me. Rather, it was one that I had known intimately almost since I could be aware of myself at six or seven. It was the sense of not being autochthonous. 
<br>
&emsp;And, as regards my mother, who raised me herself with the help of the schools that I mentioned, and whom I still consider to be my best and closest friend, belonging was portable. I mean to say that, in her case, it was a facet of personality - a quality that, being in them, she conferred to various places, rather than one that any place could vouchsafe her. 
<br>
&emsp;She was a wayfarer, my mom. So in tune with her own concerns and with the conditions of her livelihood that she seemed to be able to grow roots wherever she stood. To grow roots, that is, at will. I adored her - but that&#39;s another story.  
<br>
&emsp;Amiel said nothing as we walked. He was distrait. I flattered myself that I was able to tell that. To walk with him at night was beautifully evocative of our adolescence. And I may say that it was a case in which nostalgia meant actual pain, for, in it, I had been caught - like a beast in a trap.
<br>
&emsp;And Amiel was, of course, the venturesome trapper - the touchstone of good and evil - God's image. He was the wearer of the symbols of liberty, the only person and the person whom I awaited, shuddering at the crimson fragrance of my own blood. 
<br>
<br>
&emsp;We had to go to bed hungry because there was nothing in the house. Nothing, that is, except for the eternal tin of powdered hot chocolate, to which we paid the proper tribute by preparing it with mere water and drinking it on our feet in the kitchen. I hardly noticed the way in which it scalded because I was dizzy with fatigue, and yet, at the very same time, almost frantically alert to the stimulus that he presented by his presence in my home. I was ready for anything as we always are when we are tired and elated. But Amiel suggested that we sleep.
<br>
&emsp;It crossed my severely muddled mind that he might have some work to do - often, he did, when he was with me, though he contrived to hide all that. I conceded in my delirium, but not before asking him about his arm, which he still cradled in an odd manner. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;It&#39;s nothing - I slept on it.&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;This lie he delivered on the landing, when we were on our way up the stairs. I could wrangle the truth out of him - albeit misshapen. I had techniques, which he himself had sanctioned some years ago. I spurred myself to the effort.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Were you standing or lying down - when you were sleeping?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He glanced over his shoulder at me. &#34;Neither.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;I pondered this - or tried to - as he led me down the corridor, naturally knowing the way. My consciousness seemed stuffed with burrs. I saw him sitting, tied down of course - and, yes, sleeping. He&#39;d lost consciousness. His arms were tied around his back.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;It&#39;s your shoulder,&#34; I said, with an inspiration that was like swallowing crushed glass.
<br>
&emsp;Amiel had paused with his hand on the doorhandle of what was of course the correct room. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Usually, I have a little more time to recover,&#34; He said with obvious caution.
<br>
&emsp;I yearned to ask him what on earth had made this occasion different, but I didn&#39;t dare.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;I&#39;m sorry. I wish that there was something I could do,&#34; I muttered painfully.
<br>
&emsp;For reasons that were obscure to me, this brought a smile forth from him.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;You&#39;ll do a lot - but not right now. We&#39;re both worn out.&#34;
<br>
&emsp;I accepted this because he&#39;d said &#39;You&#39;ll do a lot,&#39; and had said it almost with cheer. And then I let him retreat into the room that had awaited him - remembering, however, the moment he shut the door, that he would find no linen on the bed. I took myself to the linen closet.  Shutting myself in, I drew firmly on the pull cord to light the place. And then I wept. What I thenrealized was that it was on the bedding which Amiel was to use - the stripy set he always had (and I am fond of tradition) - that I was shedding tears. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What&#39;s the matter?&#34; He asked me later, as I handed him the things.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Nothing,&#34; I said, which was strictly against the rules.
<br>
&emsp;His scowl told me that my violation had not gone unremarked. He could be circuitous if he wished, but I must take the direct route. Seeing that I was upset, and probably being rather upset himself, Amiel embraced me - and then it truly was good night. 
<br>
&emsp;I lay in my own bed later, thinking. But I could find no crevice for apprehension.
