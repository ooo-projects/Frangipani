<br>
&emsp;Under the unblushing sun of the bleachers, Doyin could scarcely breathe, and so it astonished her that Niji contrived to leap around the torrid court for two hours. Add to that that he did not exactly go on wing&#232;d feet. He was not a natural runner. Rather, his strengths were in his force and springiness. As she understood it, he was therefore a bit of an unlikely tennis champion. 
<br>
&emsp;He had a gradual and lovely serve, however - a beguiling serve - and could be depended upon to achieve a stinging ace in each game without conceding any. With every point that he gained, her relief turned her stomach, and the result was that she felt appallingly nauseous in addition to feeling faint. Her heart pounded hectically throughout each set in spite of her secret conviction she did not care whether or not he won. (How many times had she said so to herself?) And yet, when it was over, she wasn't sure that she could stand. 
<br>
&emsp;Applauding with the rest of the meagre audience, she watched him shake the hand of his opponent grimly over the top of the net. The sweat poured from his scalp and along his temples. Half an hour later, she sagged against him as he spoke to the other players on his team with the strange exactness that was peculiar to his speech. She couldn&#34;t follow their conversation because she felt so muzzy and weak. He laughed heartily with his coaches, and it unnerved her because he laughed so rarely. But then he had won. 
<br>
&emsp;He took her back to her dorm room, having realized that something was the matter with her.
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;It&#34;s because you don&#34;t eat,&#34; He insisted, making her sit down on the edge of her well-made bed. 
<br>
&emsp;She said, &#34;I think I&#34;m going to throw up.&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;He handed her his steel water bottle and then vanished into her bathroom. She heard the noise of the shower. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Niji, I can&#34;t.&#34;
<br> 
&emsp;He reappeared. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Drink that - quickly.&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;She drank, following orders as she did customarily with him. She was dismayed when he began to undress her, having committed herself from the very beginning to a need for absolute control as concerned her appearance, and especially her nude appearance, in his presence. But she felt that there was no limit to her exhaustion except death - she literally could not move - and behind that was a hair-raising allure. 
<br>
&emsp;She also preferred not to cry, which she thought was what might happen if she opened her mouth to argue with him. Niji helped her into the bathroom and made her sit on the shower floor, right underneath the glacial stream. He didn&#34;t stay, but left her alone there, and after no more than four or five minutes, she re-emerged in a towel to find him prone on her bed, scrolling his phone. 
<br>
&emsp;The pale blue of her striped sheets complimented both the whiteness of his clothes and the cool darkness of his skin. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Better?&#34; He asked. 
<br>
&emsp;She would have done anything for him. But he said, &#34;No, I&#34;m tired,&#34; and stood and hoisted his racquet bag on his shoulder. &#34;I&#34;ll see you on Monday. Eat something.&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;And then he left. Following a four-hour nap, during which she dreamt ecstatic colors, Doyin rallied. He had left her his water bottle, and she sat up in bed and groaned and drank from it. Jazz tunes floated mystically through the wall that adjoined the room of her neighbor. Duke Ellington. They sounded tinny and metallic, as though they came not from a speaker but from some sort of toy or music box. She listened, and then her phone began to ring. 
<br>
&emsp;The caller was Lucien - lovely Lucien, her friend - who was annoyed because she hadn't been responding to text messages. Their soft-spoken friend Gal was with her. The three were supposed to have met somewhere over half an hour prior&#59; they had plans to go to a party that evening, where a DJ of whom they knew was going to perform a set. Lucien was driving - a car had been borrowed because it was out of town. 
<br>
&emsp;Doyin ate all the walnuts in a bag of walnuts - one of many she had stashed under her bed for situations such as these - and speedily dressed herself in rose-colored mesh. She was smearing lip gloss over her eyelids when her phone began to ring again. She leapt toward it, but didn't answer the call, instead collecting her wallet from her bedside table and rushing from the room. 
<br>
&emsp;She applied her lipstick on the stairs and was surprised to find, when she emerged from her building, that night had fallen. Lucien and Gal honked from the end of the crescent. Doyin was so disturbed by the noise - by the prospect of the email that she expected to receive about it from some administrator or peer in the morning - that she didn&#39;t even remark the color of the car that she was entering. It was some kind of SUV. 
<br>
&emsp;As soon as she was in, the music started and went straight through her skin. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Where were you?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Lucien held out her palm. An indigo pill in the shape of a flying saucer sat in the center of it. Doyin took the pill.
<br> 
&emsp;&#34;I was sleeping.&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Were you? Poor baby.&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;Lucien kissed her eyelid.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Niji had a match. I almost passed out, but he won. Again!&#34;
<br>
&emsp;Taste of vermouth. Gal was driving. She drove too fast, singing along to the music, which was in French. A whispery, coquettish, and foxy voice over a driving, industrial beat. The music sort of galled her, in a good way.
<br>
&emsp;Doyin leaned forward between her friends, who sat in the front seats, now conversing, but she didn&#39;t hear their sentences. Consciousness ballooned strangely within her. The purple pill. She was most aware of herself when they drove over the bridge, where there was only a little traffic. 
<br>
&emsp;She looked ahead at the candy-lights of many cars on their lane, and the high beams streaking on the other side. She thought of the black water pulsing below somewhere and listened to her heartbeat. She knew she was in love, but something else was happening. 
<br>
&#x22B6 &#x22B7
<br>
&emsp;Dancing. The venue had turned out to be a run-down house on a creepy street of run-down houses, which were tall, narrow, and curiously distant from one another. The end of the road had fused entirely with night, and there appeared to be nothing earthly there. If the world were flat, Doyin thought muddily, then that would be its rim. 
<br>
&emsp;She found herself squinting into this living zero as Lucien read the house numbers aloud. It looked to her like outer space. And then they came to number ten, where they could hear the party down in the basement. They knocked, but no one came to the door, of course. It was open&#59; they let themselves in. 
<br>
&emsp;They were greeted, in the first instance, by a brindled gray cat, who, sidling with caution down the staircase in the front hall, had seemed initially to be either a ghost or a shadow. This cat put Doyin, who was still high, in mind of Niji, and the association revolted her. 
<br>
&emsp;No lights were on, and they had only spotted her on account of the sickly, white mist emitted by the nearest lamppost, which oozed through the sidelights. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Let&#39;s go,&#34; Gal murmured. 
<br>
&emsp;Following the music, they bypassed the staircase and went down the short corridor that led into the kitchen, where there was another doorway, in which two tall, long-haired specters awaited them.
&#34;Tickets,&#34; said one of them. 
<br>
&emsp;Doyin observed that they were identical, all the way down to the cuts on their lips. Both were gorgeous. Lucien used her phone to show them the tickets, which she had purchased over a fortnight prior. They studied her screen for a long time, and Doyin wondered whether she and her friends would be turned away on the basis of their dress or another trivial reason. They were motley: herself in pink, Gal in green, and Lucien in her usual red and blue. 
<br>
&emsp;Lucien looked particularly good, fresh-faced. Her beauty would get them in, Doyin thought, and if not, her arrogance. They were playing the filthy and textured music that she particularly liked dancing to. 
<br>
&#x22B6 &#x22B7
<br>
&emsp;When they got downstairs, it occurred to her that Niji would hate it. He did like to dance, but he preferred to do it above ground, or better still, outdoors, on a warm evening, on someone's birthday. She had gone with him to family functions in La--, and he did splendidly at those. 
<br>
&emsp;Here, you couldn&#39;t really see anyone&#39;s face. The only light coming from anywhere, other than the turntable and phone screens, was a deep, obliterating crimson. Lucien passed around a flask that she had carried in her bag. There was no sign of any alcohol, not even the rudimentary bar that they were expecting. There might be other refreshments, if they knew the right people, but they didn&#39;t know anyone, and in any case, other than Gal, who was driving, they had had their pill. 
<br>
&emsp;The three women danced, but only one of them lost herself. Only Lucien liked music. The others preferred silence, but didn&#39;t know it because it had become so rare that it seemed peculiar and otherworldly. Doyin was full of obscure concerns about Niji. He had often asked her whether she thought about him when he wasn&#39;t there - and when she said yes, he seemed to have difficulty crediting it - whereas she was afraid even to ask the question. 
<br>
&emsp;They left around 1&#58;45, but were stopped in the front hall by a man in glasses and slippers holding the cat. Doyin had thought he was a man, and then she realized that he was a teenager. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Is Yuri still down there?&#34; He asked them. 
<br>
&emsp;He pouted a little, which looked strange on someone of his height. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;We don't know Yuri,&#34; Lucien said. 
<br>
&emsp;He frowned. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;But aren&#39;t you here for his birthday?&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;No, we aren&#39;t. Sorry.&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What do you mean? You just wander into people&#39;s houses?&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;Lucien stroked the brindled cat between her ears. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;That&#39;s not what happened,&#34; she said, stifling a yawn. 
<br>
&emsp;The teenager narrowed his eyes. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;We bought tickets,&#34; Lucien explained. &#34;It was advertised as a public event. You had to have known that.&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;No. That wasn&#39;t my understanding.&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;There was a weighted pause, during which the cat purred passionately under Lucien's hand. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Well, it looks like you weren&#39;t invited either,&#34; Gal remarked. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;What do you mean?&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;You&#39;re in your pajamas.&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;He studied her. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Yuri&#39;s my friend.&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;And you&#39;re in love.&#34; Lucien grinned. &#34;Isn&#39;t that right?&#34;
<br>
&emsp;He had tensed in a way that let them all know that it was true. 
<br>
&emsp;&#34;Do you live here?&#34; Doyin asked him.
<br>
&emsp;She liked this teenager; she had decided that she liked the way he stood and the glasses that made him look tearful.
<br>
&emsp;&#34;No&#8230; I&#39;m just here for the weekend.&#34; 
<br>
&emsp;The three friends left. 
<br>
&#x22B6 &#x22B7
<br>
&emsp;Doyin and Lucien dreamt in the car. Doyin dreamt of tennis in the freshness of spring - game, set, match! And Lucien dreamt of her stalkers; there were two from her high school days, but only one since starting university.
<br>
&#x22B6 &#x22B7
<br>
&emsp;The teenager, whose name was Nour, went up to the third floor of the house, to Yuri&#39;s bedroom, and put on a record. He didn&#39;t know any of Yuri&#39;s albums, but he liked the records on the section of the shelf that was labeled Kosmische Musik. Some of it sounded quite sacred, he thought.
<br>
&emsp;Standing next to the speaker in the watery nimbus of Yuri&#39;s only lamp, he listened both to the close, friendly synthesizer sounds and the crunchier music from far below. Bridey the cat pushed herself against his ankles, but he ignored her. He was waiting.
